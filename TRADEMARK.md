Version 1.0 — February 2026

---

## Protected Names

The following names are trademarks of the Arianna Method project:

- **Arianna Method**
- **Arianna Method Language**
- **AML** (in the context of AI/ML programming languages)
- **Async Field Forever**
- **4.C**
- **Delta Voice**

## You May

- Say "built with AML" or "uses the Arianna Method kernel" if your project genuinely uses ariannamethod.c or a derivative.
- Say "compatible with AML" if your project can execute .aml scripts.
- Refer to AML by name in academic papers, articles, reviews, and documentation.
- Use the names in truthful comparative statements.

## You May Not

- Name your project "AML", "Arianna Method", or any confusingly similar variant without written permission.
- Imply endorsement by or affiliation with the Arianna Method project without written permission.
- Use these names for any product or service that violates the Acceptable Use Policy.
- Register domain names, social media accounts, or package names using these trademarks to mislead others about the origin of your project.

## Modified Versions

If you fork or substantially modify the AML kernel, you must:

1. Choose a different name for your fork.
2. Remove all Arianna Method branding.
3. State clearly that your project is a derivative, not the original.

You do not need to remove copyright notices or license headers. The LGPL v3 requires you to keep those.

## Revocation

Trademark permission is automatically revoked if you violate the Acceptable Use Policy. No notice required. No appeal.
